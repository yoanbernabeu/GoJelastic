#  completion bash

Generate the autocompletion script for bash

## Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(GoJelastic completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

### Linux:

	GoJelastic completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/GoJelastic

### macOS:

	GoJelastic completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/GoJelastic

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
GoJelastic completion bash
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --token string   A token is required
      --url string     A url is required
```
